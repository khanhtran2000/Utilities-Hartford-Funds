## Developed Utility for Hartford Funds 

Each folder contains small utilities I built during my intern at Hartford Funds. Each serves as an automatic tool for the Extract-Transform-Load (ETL) process. These utilities have automated several steps that were originally executed manually. The codes will require the SQL Server database at Hartford Funds to function properly. Therefore, these code only serve as reference documents for my future projects.
