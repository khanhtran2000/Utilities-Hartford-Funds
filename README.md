# README

A small utility I built during my intern at Hartford Funds. This serves as a validation tool for the Extract-Transform-Load (ETL) 
process. The code will require the SQL Server database at Hartford Funds to function properly. Therefore, this code only serves
as a reference document for my future projects.
